This software provides a suite of algorithms for estimating brain feature maps: curvature (for implicit brain MRI manifolds), sulcal depth maps, cortical thickness.

Inputs are essentially nifti images for binary segmentations. The user can also estimate mean and Gaussian curvature for meshes generated by Freesurfer/DHCP structural pipeline (gifti files). However, in this case, the user should also pass the corresponding nifti file as additional input to establish correspondences between real_word coordinates and vertex coordinates expressed in the image coordinate system and to perform the necessary computations in a cartesian grid.
Required softwares are available ready to run for Linux (Ubuntu) - with Windows computers being supported with a Linux Virtual Machine.
